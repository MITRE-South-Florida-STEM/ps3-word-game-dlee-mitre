# ps3-stem
This assignment is a simple word creation game. The player will be given a number of hands. For each hand, the player will receive a set number of characters, and is asked to create words. Each character can only be used once. At the end of the hand, their words are scored and then the next hand begins.

There is also `test_ps3.py` that will test your functions. When you first import to replit you can use `python test_ps3.py` to run that file. Later when you want to play the game, you can either update the `.replit` file or manually run the main file using `python ps3.py`.
